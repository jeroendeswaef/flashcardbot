The purpose of this project is to make an IRC bot for learning.

As an example, a series of cards is provided to learn the capitals of the world.

When a user joins a channel, that this bot is active on; it asks for a capital f.e. 

[14:23] <flashcardbot> France
[14:23] <you> Paris
[14:23] <flashcardbot> Correct

After you answer, it keeps asking for other capitals:

[14:24] <flashcardbot> Iceland
[14:24] <you> Rij
[14:24] <flashcardbot> False, the correct answer is: Reykjavik
